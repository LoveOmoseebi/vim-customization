# My customization repo
This is the repo for my vim and bash customization.

It contains my personalized .vimrc and .bashrc files.

## Here are the few features in them:

### For bash
* Shows the current working git branch.
* The branch is shown in a very beautiful 256 ascii color variant
* Contains some aliases for common git commands, such as gad (git add), gic (git commit -m), log (git log --oneline -3), and many more.

### For vim
* Auto-indent the next line
* Marks the standard 80 characters on a line point
* Sets the relative number line
* Esc key remapped to jj. To press literal 'jj' characters, wait for one 1sec after pressing the first j.
* Many more features
